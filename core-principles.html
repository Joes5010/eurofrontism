            <h2>Core Principles</h2>
            <p>Here are the core principles of Eurofrontism:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preserving National Essence within European Unity:</strong> In a united federal Europe, the unique identity of each nation — its people, languages, history, heritage, customs, and all that defines it — will be protected and kept alive. While political sovereignty unites under one European banner, the soul of every country will remain untouched, forming the living fabric of a shared European civilization.

.</li>
                 <li><strong>Unified Defense and Common Purpose:</strong> Advocating for a united Europe capable of defending itself against external threats, with member states standing together under one banner while honoring their unique histories and people.</li>
               <li><strong>Preservation of National Identity:</strong> While united under a single European state, each nation's language, history, heritage, traditions, and people will be respected and preserved — ensuring the soul of every country remains alive within the greater European civilization.</li>
                <li><strong>Socially-Oriented Governance:</strong> Support for government policies that prioritize the well-being of the people, incorporating socialist ideas in terms of social safety nets and ensuring the general welfare of the citizenry.</li>
                <li><strong>Strong and Respected Government:</strong> Advocacy for a capable and respected government that can maintain order, enforce laws, and command the respect of all citizens, including the youth through fostering discipline.</li>
                <li><strong>Controlled and Legal Migration:</strong> Acceptance of legal immigration processes while opposing mass and illegal immigration, with a focus on maintaining social cohesion and national identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Rejection of Extremism:</strong> Opposition to all forms of political extremism, recognizing the importance of balance and reasoned discourse.</li>
                <li><strong>Rejection of Marxist Socialism and Capitalism (In terms of Class Conflict):</strong> Both systems, despite their opposing ideologies, fail to resolve class conflict—Marxist socialism often exchanges one hierarchy for another, while capitalism exploits workers for profit..</li>
                 <li><strong>Rejection of Communism and Fascism:</strong> Clear opposition to both communist and fascist political systems.</li>
            </ul>
