            <h2>Core Principles</h2>
            <p>Here are the core principles of Eurofrontism:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nationalism and Continentalism:</strong> A deep love and loyalty for one's own nation, coupled with a strong sense of shared European identity and destiny. This involves prioritizing the well-being and interests of European nations and peoples.</li>
                <li><strong>Independent European Nations:</strong> Belief in a Europe composed of sovereign and culturally independent nations, each maintaining its unique identity and self-governance.</li>
                 <li><strong>Inter-European Cooperation against External Threats:</strong> Recognizing the need for European nations to stand together and cooperate against common enemies and external pressures, while preserving their individual sovereignty.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Independence:</strong> Emphasis on preserving and promoting the distinct cultures, traditions, and languages of European nations, resisting cultural homogenization.</li>
                <li><strong>Socially-Oriented Governance:</strong> Support for government policies that prioritize the well-being of the people, incorporating socialist ideas in terms of social safety nets and ensuring the general welfare of the citizenry.</li>
                <li><strong>Strong and Respected Government:</strong> Advocacy for a capable and respected government that can maintain order, enforce laws, and command the respect of all citizens, including the youth through fostering discipline.</li>
                <li><strong>Controlled and Legal Migration:</strong> Acceptance of legal immigration processes while opposing mass and illegal immigration, with a focus on maintaining social cohesion and national identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Rejection of Extremism:</strong> Opposition to all forms of political extremism, recognizing the importance of balance and reasoned discourse.</li>
                <li><strong>Rejection of Marxist Socialism and Capitalism (In terms of Class Conflict):</strong> Both systems, despite their opposing ideologies, fail to resolve class conflictâ€”Marxist socialism often exchanges one hierarchy for another, while capitalism exploits workers for profit..</li>
                 <li><strong>Rejection of Communism and Fascism:</strong> Clear opposition to both communist and fascist political systems.</li>
            </ul>
